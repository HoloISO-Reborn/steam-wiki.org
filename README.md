## Versions codenames meaning

Example with V.1.2.4
V.1.x.x = 1st part is for **public release** (version used on current release)
V.x.2.x = 2nd is for **Beta** (testing) users. Contact me to join Beta release channel
V.x.x.4 = Last part is for unstable release, which means 
(x = Number of the release version)

Each part will evolve beginning from the last part then moving forward to the left if agreed, until being released on a public release.

For example, V.x.x.5 will be moved to V.(x+1).x if officially agreed by the community, then public release if admins are ok with it.
